# Bash Loop
___
# Question
We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numb$

### HINTS
Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'.$

### Solution

1. First i nagivate to the directory:- /problems/77ad2ec283d51f7b1ddc449ffe109e0b
   ```bash
   cd /problems/77ad2ec283d51f7b1ddc449ffe109e0b in the terminal.
   ```
2. Then i saw two files was their

   ```cd /problems/77ad2ec283d51f7b1ddc449ffe109e0b``` in the terminal.
   ```bash
   A> BashLoop (Binary file) 
   B> Flag (But we don't had permisson to open the flag file directely.
   ```
3. Then i tried to execute that Binary file 
   And it says
   ```bash
   $./Bashloop
   "What number am I thinking of? It is between 0 and 4096"
   ```
4. So if we do
   ```bash
   ./Bashloop 3
   ```
   Then it says
   ```text
   $ ./bashloop 1337
   Nope. Pick another number between 0 and 4096

   ```text

5. So now read the hint It says:-
   ```text
   Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well!
   ```
So now we can use FOR loop 
    ```link
    https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-loops.php
    ```
Read about for loop their, 
Now 
lets make for last payload 
we can use any number from 0 to 4096
then 

```bash
for spirit in {0..4096};do /problems/77ad2ec283d51f7b1ddc449ffe109e0b/bashloop $spirit |grep -v "Nope. Pick another number between 0 and 4096"; done
```

and we got the flag
```bash
$ for spirit in {0..4096}; do /problems/77ad2ec283d51f7b1ddc449ffe1
09e0b/bashloop $spirit |grep -v "Nope. Pick another number bet
ween 0 and 4096"; done

Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: 9963698b982d491536db
b9cec73a417e
```
