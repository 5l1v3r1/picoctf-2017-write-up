# Just no

### Question

A program at /problems/f6ae7c5798439ab46292af914f47b170 has access to a flag but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?

### HINTS

Check out the difference between relative and absolute paths and see if you can figure out how to use them to solve this challenge. Could you possibly spoof another auth file it looks at instead...?

# Solution

It was just a simple challenge. 

1. Lets check what are the files in the challenge directory.
    ```bash
    cd /problems/f6ae7c5798439ab46292af914f47b170
    ```
    I saw 4 files was their 
    ```
    auth  flag  justno  justno.c
    ```
2. After it i checked the ```justno.c``` file. 
    ```
    fopen("../../problems/f6ae7c5798439ab46292af914f47b170/auth","r")
    ```

    so it's opening auth file. Lets check what is written in ```auth```. 

3. So inside ```auth```,       ```"no"``` was written. 

4. so why don't spoof it out change it with yes ;) 
        ```bash
        ~mkdir ~problems/f6ae7c5798439ab46292af914f47b170
        ~cd problems/f6ae7c5798439ab46292af914f47b170
        ~echo "yes" > auth 
        ```
        now run that ```justno``` binary. 
       
       ```
       ~/problems/f6ae7c5798439ab46292af914f47b170/justno
        
        Oh. Well the auth file doesn't say no anymore so... Here's the
         flag: 08c0c2008f63cd44596dc13be08dd3ac
        ```

and we got the flag.
