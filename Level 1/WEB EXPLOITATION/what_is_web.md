# What Is Web
___

### Question

Someone told me that some guy came up with the "World Wide Web", using "HTML" and "stuff". Can you help me figure out what that is? Website.

### HINTS
How can you figure out how the webpage is actually built?

___

### Solution
This one is pretty easy, this challenge requires very basic understanding of how websites function.
As mentioned in the hint, we can check the source code of the website by gitting ctrl+U to view the source code of the website.
Here we can see line of comments in the end giving out the first part of the flag :
```html
<!-- Cool! Look at me! This is an HTML file. It describes what each page contains in a format your browser can understand. -->
<!-- The first part of the flag (there are 3 parts) is 9daca0510ff -->
<!-- What other types of files are there in a webpage? -->
```
Now we need to look at the other components of a webpage. First, we'll jump to the hacker.css file to look for more and voila we have something in the comments :
```
/*
This is the css file. It contains information on how to graphically display
the page. It is in a seperate file so that multiple pages can all use the same 
one. This allows them all to be updated by changing just this one.
The second part of the flag is eb6c5680635 
*/
```
Now, there's one more file left which is script.js, opening the file gives us this in :
```
/* This is a javascript file. It contains code that runs locally in your
 * browser, although it has spread to a large number of other uses.
 *
 * The final part of the flag is f1ef52d049f
 */
```

Now we combining all the parts together we have our flag : 9daca0510ffeb6c5680635f1ef52d049f

Adios :) @cyb3rw0rm
