# Yarn
___

### Question

I was told to use the linux strings command on yarn, but it doesn't work. Can you help? I lost the flag in the binary somewhere, and would like it back

### HINTS
+ What does the strings command use to determine if something is a string?
+ Is there an option to change the length of what strings considers as valid?

### Solution
I did not actually solved it the way it was supposed to. Whenever I'm given a file, I always check the contents of that file using cat command, I did the same with this file. 
While going throught all the mess that there was, I saw this string which sort of seemed like a flag, "Submit_me_for_I_am_the_flag". And guess what, I hit the bull's eye :-p 

Adios :) @cyb3rw0rm
